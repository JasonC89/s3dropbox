A Java-based GUI front-end to Amazon S3.

This is a Java Swing application into which you can drag and drop files, which are then uploaded to your
Amazon S3 account. You can create public links to these files, and paste these links into emails, so that
the files can be downloaded later (using any web browser) by clicking on the link, or you can download the
files yourself at a later stage using the application.

Run using: java -jar S3DropBox-<version>.jar [credentials file]

The credentials file is optional. If not present, the application will look for a file called .s3dropbox
in your home directory. If that is not present you will be asked for some AWS credentials when the
application starts and then a .s3dropbox file will be created in your home directory.

Here are the values that the .s3dropbox file will contain:

AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID

    * Required entry.
    * This is the public key provided to you by Amazon when you sign up for an S3 account.

AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

    * Required entry.
    * This is the secret key provided to you by Amazon when you sign up for an S3 account.

USE_SSL

    * Optional entry.
    * Versions 1.6+ of the S3DropBox use HTTPS by default. Older versions used HTTP.
    * If you want to use HTTPS then simply set this option to either 'true' or 'yes'.
    * If you want to use HTTP then simply set this option to either 'false' or 'no'.

PROXY_HOST and PROXY_PORT

    * Optional entries.
    * If you need to connect to the internet via a HTTP proxy then you should provide
      the hostname or IP address of the proxy and its port using these options.

PROXY_USERNAME and PROXY_PASSWORD

    * Optional entries.
    * If your HTTP proxy requires username and password authentication then you should
      provide them via these options. The S3DropBox is capable of using BASIC, DIGEST
      and NTLM authentication mechanisms.

NTLM_HOST and NTLM_DOMAIN

    * Optional entries.
    * These are not usually required even if you need to use NTLM authentication with
      a HTTP proxy. If you are unable to authenticate with an NTLM proxy using just the
      username and password options then you may need to provide the HOST and DOMAIN options.
